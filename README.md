# WebTUI+Bootstrap

I wanted to use the incredible style of WebTUI without a framework and with Bootstrap for responsive layout and jQuery.

It is not pretty, but it works good enough for my needs.

Big shout out to [WebTUI](https://webtui.ironclad.sh/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/webtui/webtui)).
